# This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn dev`
##### Runs the app in the development mode.
* Open to view it in the browser.

`yarn gen`
* ##### Run the grahpql code generator to do an instrocpection of the current Backend API Schema,
* ##### beside to generate new query hooks to use them in the app

### The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### Create a local .env file
To run correctly this app, it's mandatory to create a .env file with local variables like

1- REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT = https://musala-proyect.herokuapp.com/

Once you create this file with that variable inside, you must restart the whole node app, to take efects over the code
